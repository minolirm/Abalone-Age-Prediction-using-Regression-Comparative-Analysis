# Abalone-Age-Prediction-using-Regression-Comparative-Analysis
This project investigates the effectiveness of multiple regression and machine learning models for predicting the age of abalones using their physical characteristics. The study uses the Abalone dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes physical measurements such as length, diameter, height, and shell weight.

## üìò Overview  
This project investigates the effectiveness of multiple regression and machine learning models for predicting the **age of abalones** using their physical characteristics. The **Abalone dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** is used, which includes measurements such as length, diameter, height, and shell weight.

Accurately predicting abalone age is essential for the **fisheries sector**, as age directly impacts the **economic value** of abalone. Traditional age estimation by counting shell rings is time-consuming; hence, this project uses statistical and machine learning approaches to automate and improve prediction accuracy.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Compare different **regression models** for abalone age prediction.  
- Evaluate model performance using **RMSE** and **R¬≤** values.  
- Assess **computational efficiency** across models.  
- Explore the impact of **feature engineering** (scaling, transformation).  
- Identify the **best-performing model** for practical use in fisheries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  

### üîπ Data Preprocessing  
- Converted `Sex` categorical variable to numeric.  
- Applied **Standard Scaling** to all predictors:  
  \[
  x_{scaled} = \frac{x - mean(x)}{sd(x)}
  \]
- Split dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing** subsets.  
- Applied **feature engineering** (scaling + log transformation).  
- Used **10-fold cross-validation** for all models to avoid overfitting and find optimal hyperparameters.
