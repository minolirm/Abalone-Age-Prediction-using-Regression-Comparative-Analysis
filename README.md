# Abalone-Age-Prediction-using-Regression-Comparative-Analysis

1. This analysis is performed to predict the age of abalones using Regression approach. 
2. The study is focused on comparing the performance of different machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning using 10-fold cross validation
3. R programming language is used to implement the algorithms
4. An explonatory data analysis is performed initially to get a clear idea about the distribution of the data
5. The models include multiple linear regression, Principal Component Regressor (PCR), Ridge Regressor, Lasso Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, 
Support Vector Regressor, Neural Network, and Bayesian Regression model.
